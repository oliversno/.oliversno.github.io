Hi, I'm Sean. Welcome.

I am a Software Engineer and student living in Ann Arbor, MI.

I am an undergraduate student at the University of Michigan in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.
      I often describe what I do as "I use computers to solve problems", and that's how I see what I do, problem-solving.
      My interests span the range of robotics, control, software development, algorithms, discrete mathematics,
      machine learning, and computer vision.
      My goal is to work on cutting edge automated technologies that help make the world a nicer place.
      When I'm not programming I enjoy hiking, camping,phillosophy, cooking, and music.
